*** Building Auto Screen Capture ***
There's a "build.bat" script in the "autoscreen\build" directory that does a Release build and uses ILMerge to
merge the assemblies into a single executable named "autoscreen.exe" (renamed from AutoScreenCapture.exe during the build).
It also signs the assembly with a key file.

*** Release of autoscreen.exe ***
The portable executable "autoscreen.exe" in "autoscreen\bin\Release" is produced by running the "build.bat" script.
It is then uploaded to SourceForge and it usually takes a few days for software distribution sites to pick up the latest version.

*** Release of AutoScreenCaptureSetup.msi ***
For those who want an installer run the build.bat script and then build the
"AutoScreenCaptureSetup" project in Release mode to make "AutoScreenCaptureSetup.msi"
in "autoscreen\AutoScreenCaptureSetup\Release" using autoscreen.exe from "autoscreen\bin\Release".
Upload the AutoScreenCaptureSetup.msi installer from "autoscreen\AutoScreenCaptureSetup\Release".
