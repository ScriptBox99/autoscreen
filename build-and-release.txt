*** Building Auto Screen Capture ***
There's a "build.bat" script in the "autoscreen\build" directory that does a Release build and uses ILMerge to
merge the assemblies into a single executable named "autoscreen.exe" (renamed from AutoScreenCapture.exe during the build).

====== build.bat ======
del /s /q ..\bin\Release\*.*
rmdir /s /q ..\bin\Release\!autoscreen
rmdir /s /q ..\bin\Release\screenshots
msbuild ..\autoscreen_vs2019.sln /p:Configuration=Release -restore
ILMerge ..\bin\Release\AutoScreenCapture.exe /out:..\bin\Release\autoscreen.exe ..\bin\Release\Renci.SshNet.dll ..\bin\Release\Gavin.Kendall.SFTP.dll
del ..\bin\Release\AutoScreenCapture.exe
del ..\bin\Release\autoscreen.pdb
del ..\bin\Release\AutoScreenCapture.exe.config

=======================

*** Release of autoscreen.exe ***
The portable executable "autoscreen.exe" in "autoscreen\bin\Release" is produced by running the "build.bat" script.
It is then uploaded to SourceForge and it usually takes a few days for software distribution sites to pick up the latest version.

*** Release of AutoScreenCaptureSetup.msi ***
For those who want an installer simply build the solution in Release mode to
produce the AutoScreenCapture.exe binary and its dependent libraries then build
the "AutoScreenCaptureSetup" project in Release mode to make "AutoScreenCaptureSetup.msi"
in "autoscreen\AutoScreenCaptureSetup\Release" using AutoScreenCapture.exe from "autoscreen\bin\Release".
Upload the AutoScreenCaptureSetup.msi installer from "autoscreen\AutoScreenCaptureSetup\Release".
