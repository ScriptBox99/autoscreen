There's a "build.bat" script in the "autoscreen\build" directory that does a Release build and uses ILMerge to
merge the assemblies into a single executable named "autoscreen.exe" (renamed from AutoScreenCapture.exe during the build).

The setup/installer "AutoScreenCaptureSetup.msi" will be compiled using the "autoscreen.exe" executable from bin\Release.

The Release folders for the AutoScreenCapture and AutoScreenCaptureSetup projects will be cleaned up by the batch script.

When you look in the "autoscreen\build" directory you should see "autoscreen.exe" and "AutoScreenCaptureSetup.msi".
Both are signed using the certificate named "autoscreen.pfx" found in the autoscreen directory.

SourceForge has a directory structure where you simply upload the EXE and the MSI. I usually put them in a folder
named after the version number. GitHub requires the branch you're targeting and a version number when drafting a release.
You can also upload the EXE and MSI to GitHub but it's not necessary. I think most people download from SourceForge anyway.
